## API setup on local machine

To set up the flask API on your machine, first create a python virtual environment in this folder from the root directory with:

`python -m venv .venv`

Next, activate the environment with:

`source .venv/bin/activate`

Then, to install the requirements run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally you can decativate the environment with:

`deactivate`

Note: you may need to replace `python` and/or `pip` with `python3` and/or `pip3`
